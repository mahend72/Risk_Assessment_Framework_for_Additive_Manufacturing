# **Risk Assessment Framework for Additive Manufacturing**
The risk assessment framework is a proactive approach leveraging cyber threat intelligence tools to identify, analyse, and assess potential threats in the additive manufacturing (AM) supply chain.

# Features
The system identifies seven potential assets and 22 possible threats.




# Threat Impact
Threat impact is estimated based on the following threat characteristics:
* Targetted precision: Measures how accurately the threat can focus on specific victims or systems.
* Area of Impact
* Collateral Damage
* Stealth
* Attack Repeatability


# Threat Likelihood
The following attributes determine threat likelihood:
* trust in the data source 
* the severity of the threat
* threat frequency



# Evaluation
The study demonstrates the usefulness of the risk assessment technique in finding severe CVEs that represent significant vulnerabilities to AM settings using the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dataset.
