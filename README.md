# **Risk Assessment Framework for Additive manufacturing**
##### The risk assessment framework a proactive approach to identifying, analysing, and assessing potential threats to additive manufacturing (AM) settings. The system identifies seven potential assets and 22 possible threats that adversaries may attack and assess threat attributes such as targetted precision, area of impact, collateral damage, stealth, and attack repeatability to estimate their potential impact. The likelihood of each threat is determined by considering the dependability of data sources, the severity of the threat, and the frequency with which it occurs. Based on the risk assessment technique, the threats are assessed and assigned a threat score using a risk matrix. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the risk assessment technique in finding severe CVEs that represent significant vulnerabilities to AM settings using the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dataset.
