# **Risk Assessment Framework for Additive Manufacturing**
The risk assessment framework is a proactive approach leveraging cyber threat intelligence tools to identify, analyse, and assess potential threats in the additive manufacturing (AM) supply chain.

# Features
The system identifies seven potential assets and 22 possible threats.




# Threat Impact
Threat impact is estimated based on the following threat characteristics:
* _Targetted precision_: Measures how accurately the threat can focus on specific victims or systems.
* _Area of Impact_: Assesses the extent of systems, networks, or regions affected by the threat.
* _Collateral Damage_: Evaluates unintended consequences affecting non-targeted entities.
* _Stealth_: Determines how well the threat evades detection by security measures.
* _Attack Repeatability_: Gauges how easily the threat can be executed multiple times.


# Threat Likelihood
The following attributes determine threat likelihood:
* trust in the data source 
* the severity of the threat
* threat frequency



# Evaluation
The study demonstrates the usefulness of the risk assessment technique in finding severe CVEs that represent significant vulnerabilities to AM settings using the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dataset.
