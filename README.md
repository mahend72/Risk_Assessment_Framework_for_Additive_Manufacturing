# **Risk Assessment Framework for Additive manufacturing**
The risk assessment framework a proactive approach leveraging cyberthreat intelligence tool to identifying, analysing, and assessing potential threats to additive manufacturing (AM) settings.


# Features
The system identifies seven potential assets and 22 possible threats.

# Threat Impact
Threat impact is estimated based on the following threat characteristics:
* _Targetted precision
* Area of Impact
* Collateral Damage
* Stealth
* Attack Repeatability_


# Threat Likelihood
Threat likelihood is determined with following attributes:
* _trust on data source 
* severity of the threat
* threat frequency_



# Evaluation
The study demonstrates the usefulness of the risk assessment technique in finding severe CVEs that represent significant vulnerabilities to AM settings using the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dataset.
