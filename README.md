# **Risk Assessment Framework for Additive manufacturing**
The risk assessment framework a proactive approach leveraging cyberthreat intelligence tool to identifying, analysing, and assessing potential threats to additive manufacturing (AM) settings.


#**Features**
The system identifies seven potential assets and 22 possible threats.



#**Threat Impact**
Threat impact is estimated based on the following threat characteristics:
_Targetted precision
Area of Impact
Collateral Damage
Stealth
Attack Repeatability_

#**Threat Likelihood**
Threat likelihood is determined with following attributes:
_trust on data source 
severity of the threat
threat frequency_

#**Evaluation **
The study demonstrates the usefulness of the risk assessment technique in finding severe CVEs that represent significant vulnerabilities to AM settings using the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dataset.
